### What is IPFS? ðŸŒŒ

The InterPlanetary File System "is a peer-to-peer (p2p) filesharing system that aims to fundamentally change the way information is distributed across & beyond the globe. IPFS consists of several innovations in communication protocols and distributed systems that have been combined to produce a file system like no other."

"It attempts to address the deficiencies of the client-server model and HTTP web through a novel p2p file sharing system."
